## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in analyzing Airbnb data for Boston and Seattle:

I will be pulling in 2016 and 2017 year's Airbnb data for Boston and Seattle and will be analyzing the data to answer below questions:

1. Property price comparison between the regions.
2. Various features that affect the price and their correlation.
3. Predicting future prices by building a model using the existing features.



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@vijay2035/airbnb-data-analysis-boston-or-seattle-5c705130d3d7).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data , https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
